# 🔊 Ora

**Ora** is an open-source Linux alternative to [Balabolka](http://www.cross-plus-a.com/balabolka.htm), built with GTK3 and [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) — 100% offline, neural text-to-speech.

---

## Features

- **Neural TTS** via Piper — high-quality, fully offline after initial voice download
- **30+ languages** (French, English, German, Spanish, and more)
- **Voice auto-download** — models fetched automatically on first use; no manual setup
- **Sentence-level chunking** — text is split into chunks for low-latency start and fine-grained progress reporting
- **Chunk highlight** — the currently playing sentence is highlighted in blue in the text area; the view auto-scrolls to follow along
- **Per-chunk PCM cache** with LRU eviction — instant re-playback without re-synthesis
- **Pause / Resume** — SIGSTOP/SIGCONT on the audio subprocess; no quality loss
- **Restart** — jump back to the first chunk without re-typing
- **Clipboard watcher** (opt-in) — auto-reads clipboard every 500 ms and speaks new content
- **Clipboard quick-read** button — paste and play in one click
- **Progress bar** — shows chunk-level progress (e.g. "Chunk 3/7")
- **Voice quick-switch** in the status bar — switch voices without opening Settings
- **Settings dialog** — manage installed voices, cache size, and clipboard watcher
- **Offline mode** — if no internet, only locally installed voices are available
- **Speed control** — ×0.5 to ×2 via a slider
- **UI language** auto-detected from system locale (French / English)
- **All settings persisted** across restarts: language, voice, speed, text, cache limits, clipboard preferences
- **Dark theme**

## Requirements

### System

```bash
sudo apt install python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-3.0 espeak-ng alsa-utils
```

Compatible with **Ubuntu 22.04+** and **Linux Mint 21+**.

### Piper

```bash
pip install piper-tts pathvalidate --break-system-packages
```

> If `pip` is not available: `sudo apt install python3-pip`
>
> `pathvalidate` is a dependency of `piper-tts` that is not always installed automatically — without it, no audio is produced.

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/ora.git
cd ora
python3 -m ora
```

---

## Usage

1. **Select a voice** from the status-bar dropdown — voices already downloaded are shown; others are downloaded automatically when you click **▶ Play**.
2. **Type or paste text** in the text area.
3. **▶ Play** — starts synthesis and playback, chunk by chunk.
4. **⏸ Pause / ▶ Resume** — suspends or resumes audio at any point.
5. **⏮ Restart** — restarts playback from the first chunk.
6. **⏹ Stop** — interrupts playback immediately.
7. **📋** — reads clipboard content into the text area and starts playback.
8. **● (clipboard dot)** in the status bar — click to toggle the automatic clipboard watcher.
9. **⚙ Settings** — manage voices, cache, and clipboard preferences.

## Recommended French voices

| Voice | Gender | Quality |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `fr_FR-siwis-medium` | Female | ★★★★☆ |
| `fr_FR-mls-medium`   | Female | ★★★☆☆ |

## Building a .deb package

```bash
sudo apt install fakeroot dpkg-dev
make deb
sudo dpkg -i ora_1.0.0_all.deb
```

---

## Roadmap

Items that are **not yet implemented** but planned:

### Balabolka parity

- **Open documents** — load TXT, PDF, EPUB, DOCX, ODT, HTML and other formats directly into the text area
- **Export to audio file** — save the synthesised speech as MP3, WAV, OGG or FLAC
- **Navigation controls** — jump to previous / next sentence or paragraph during playback
- **Bookmarks** — save and restore named positions within a text

### Lower priority

- **Word-level highlight during playback** — requires Piper to emit per-word timestamps (not yet available in the stable Piper API)
- **Flatpak packaging** — needs a Flatpak manifest and GNOME runtime
- **Systray support** — would allow Ora to run in the background with a tray icon
